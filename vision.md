# Vision

<!-- DELETE this guidance block after writing your vision statement.

The vision statement tells the agent — and your future self — what this project
is and what it is not. Write it once, early. Revise it when the project's
identity sharpens.

A good vision statement covers:

1. **What it does** — one sentence. What does the user get from this project?
2. **Core contrasts** — the tensions that define the project's identity.
   Every project sits somewhere between competing values (legibility vs.
   completeness, stability vs. sensitivity, speed vs. precision). Name them.
   These contrasts will reappear in feature specs and guide design decisions.
3. **What it does not do** — the boundary. What is explicitly out of scope?
   This prevents the project from expanding into everything adjacent.
4. **Inspectability** — can the output be questioned and debugged? State
   the commitment to transparency (or deliberately state the tradeoff).
5. **Scale** — does it work on one thing or many? Does it compose?
6. **Relationship to other projects** — if this is part of a larger system,
   state what it provides and what it consumes. Keep its own vision narrow.

If this file is empty, the agent will ask you to write it together.
