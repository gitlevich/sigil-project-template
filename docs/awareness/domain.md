# Domain

## Language Rules

- Use domain vocabulary exactly. No synonyms, no paraphrasing, no generic terms when a precise domain term exists.
- A term within its bounded context means only what that context defines. Prefix foreign terms with their domain.
- Sigils are inert structure. Never attribute agency to them. Write "I do X through the application" not "the application does X."

## Terms

Always in scope. Never need introduction.

- **Attention** — limited resource split across contrasts; conserved
- **Frame** — totality of current perception; aggregate of observations
- **Sigil** — attractor of attention + membrane; inert until entered; filter then map
- **Membrane** — sigil's inclusion criteria; filters relevant contrasts
- **Contrast** — axis of differentiation; bipolar (two poles) or unipolar (more/less)
- **Pole** — one end of a bipolar contrast
- **Category** — unipolar sigil; recognized attractor in frame
- **Observation** — reading along a contrast
- **Preference** — tendency toward a pole; develops inside a sigil
- **Collapse** — interpreting filtered frame into coherent reading
- **Choice** — action within a sigil; result of collapse
- **Affordance** — named part of a sigil; what it offers attention
- **Leaf** — sigil not entered further; name and contract known
- **Stack** — layered sigils; later overrides earlier on shared contrasts
- **Flatten** — computing stack result into single preference set
- **Taste** — composite of all preferences along all contrasts; portable
- **Entanglement** — correlated collapses between neighbors; emergent
- **Narrative capture** — attention trapping itself via the story it tells inside a sigil
- **Observer** — attention without a sigil; in superposition
- **Wearing a sigil** — entering it; membrane filters frame, preferences develop
