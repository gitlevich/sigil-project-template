# Domain Language Background

This document establishes the broader context of sigils, attention, and recognition that Sigil Scope operates within. It is not specific to this project — it is the foundational theory that any sigil-based instrument inherits.

## Sigil as Attractor

A sigil is an attractor of attention within a membrane. The membrane defines what is relevant — which contrasts pass through. The attractor is what pulls attention in: a pattern stable enough to be recognized, interesting enough to be entered. Without the membrane, the attractor has no boundary. Without the attractor, the membrane encloses nothing worth attending to.

## Collapse and Superposition

Collapse is any observation resolving into something definite through a sigil. It is not limited to action. Recognizing a face is a collapse. Choosing what to do next is a collapse. Both are observations that were in superposition — undetermined — and are now positively identified.

What I did not attend to remains in superposition. No attractor pulled my attention there, so no collapse occurred. The observations remain undefined — not hidden, not absent, just unresolved. I have no sigil for them.

## Recognition

A sigil is not constructed on encounter. It is recognized. Recognition means I have seen this pattern before and it emerges from memory, arriving fully loaded: its contrasts, its preferences, the choices available within it. The match between current observation and stored pattern is what brings the whole structure into my frame.

The sigil pre-exists the moment of observation. Its membrane, its preferences, its choice space — all formed in prior encounters and compressed into memory. Recognition is decompression: the pattern fires, and its full structure becomes available to attention.

## Hierarchical Recognition

Recognition is hierarchical and iterative — a matryoshka.

First, I recognize the broad situation: the outermost sigil. This narrows the contrast space. Within that, I recognize one or more sigils at the same level — a group of people, say — and then I focus, and some of them resolve further: these are my friends. Recognition moves both downward into depth and laterally across neighbors at the same level.

The hierarchy deepens where I attend and stays shallow where I do not. I do not decompose what does not interest me.

## Sigil Creation

Two paths produce new sigils:

**Refinement.** I have a sigil that roughly matches, but it is not specific enough. On the next iteration, I either create a child sigil within it — more specific — or sharpen the existing one. The existing sigil is not wrong, just insufficiently resolved.

**Novel detection.** I see something I have no sigil for. I detect a pattern — structure without a name. If it is relevant, it gets remembered as a new sigil. The unnamed becomes named through relevance. If it is not relevant, it dissolves.

Both paths are encounter-driven. Sigils are not designed top-down and installed. They accumulate through encounter: recognition, refinement, new sigils where existing ones lack resolution.

## Memory as Lossy Compression

A remembered sigil is a lossy compression of an encounter. It records only the contrasts attended to, only the observations that drove the collapse, and the choice that resulted. Every contrast not attended to, every observation that did not matter — these stay in superposition, never recorded.

Memory stores the minimum needed for future recognition. Each new encounter of the same sigil refines the compression: adjusts which contrasts matter, sharpens the preferences, maybe includes an observation that turns out to be decision-relevant after all.

This is efficient by design. The sigil is the memory format.

## Sources of Contrast

Contrasts have two sources:

**Semantic.** I define these. They are named and linguistic. Two subtypes:
- **Bipolar** — two connected poles (bright vs. dark). An observation sits somewhere between them.
- **Unipolar / Category** — a single attractor (portrait). No opposite pole — just more or less of it. A category is a sigil: a recognized attractor in the frame.

**Emergent.** The data reveals these. They are unnamed and non-linguistic. Dimensionality reduction, visual embeddings, clustering — axes that structure the observations but carry no words. They exist because the data organizes that way, not because anyone declared a contrast.

The two sources interact. Semantic contrasts provide the initial structure I bring to the frame. Emergent contrasts appear as the corpus grows and reveals its own organization.

## Promotion

The boundary between semantic and emergent is permeable. When I look at an emergent contrast and recognize it — "that axis is separating indoor from outdoor" — I name it, and it becomes semantic. But promotion is not guaranteed. Some emergent contrasts stay as felt sense: I detect the axis, it affects my collapse, but I cannot name it. It sits there as a sense of something, not explicitly articulated.

## Frame Rate

Frame rate is scale-dependent.

For a single image, a frame is the image itself. Frame rate may be meaningless at this scale — or it may refer to the different channels through which analysis occurs (coarse vs. fine features, semantic vs. structural), each constituting a sub-frame.

At corpus scale, frame rate is the ingestion rate: new images per unit of time entering the corpus. Each arrival is a new frame that potentially shifts the shape of the corpus sigil. The sigil evolves with the frame rate of its scale.
