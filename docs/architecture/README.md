# Architecture

Structural documents that define how sigils compose and how the project's conceptual framework works.

## Files

- **sigil_architecture.md** — The foundational framework. Defines frame, contrast, observation, attention, sigil, membrane, collapse, composition, and entanglement. This is not project-specific — it is the universal grammar that all sigil-structured projects share.

## What Belongs Here

- Documents that define the structural rules of the system, independent of any single feature
- Composition algebra — how sigils stack, override, and flatten
- Design principles that constrain how features are decomposed

## What Does Not Belong Here

- Feature-specific specs (those live in `features/`)
- Working process rules (those live in `docs/awareness/`)
- Implementation details (those live in code)
