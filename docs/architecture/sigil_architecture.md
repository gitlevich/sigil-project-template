# Sigil Architecture

I am. As in, here I am attending to this Frame.

## Frame

The Frame is what that I observe now: my sensorium.

## Contrasts and Observation

A contrast is an axis along which I differentiate. It can be bipolar — between two mutually exclusive poles, like faster and slower — or unipolar — more or less of a category. A category is a sigil: an attractor I recognize in my frame. I have a preference for more or less of it. An observation is my reading along a contrast. My frame is the aggregate of all my observations within one moment.

## Attention

Attention is a limited resource. I split it across the contrasts I differentiate, zoomed out to include my entire frame at low resolution. Attention is conserved — redistributing it toward one contrast requires others to yield. The total is constant. I can favor one axis or balance all equally, but I cannot create attention from nothing.

When I am not wearing a sigil, I am a pure observer. An observer is attention from here and now at this scale. I am not narrating, not collapsing anything. My observations remain in superposition — I have no reason to collapse them one way or another. I recognize sigils in my frame, but they neither push me nor pull me. I am balanced.

I enter a sigil when something becomes interesting — when something starts to happen. A closed door opens. A pattern flickers. That is the transition from observer to agent: I was balanced, something shifted, and now I am inside, collapsing observations into a choice through the preferences I develop within the sigil.

## Sigil

A sigil is an attractor of attention surrounded by a membrane. It is an inert structure. It has no agency and no attention of its own. It exists as structure only — membrane plus contents — until attention enters and animates it. Functionally, a sigil is a filter followed by a map: the filter passes only relevant contrasts, the map collapses the attended observations into a choice.

### Membrane

The membrane is the sigil's inclusion criteria. It has one job: filter. It specifies which contrasts are relevant inside this sigil and blocks the rest.

### Wearing a Sigil

When I enter a sigil, the membrane filters my frame down to the contrasts that matter here. Attention, now operating within these surviving contrasts, develops preferences along each of them. This is not the membrane's doing — the membrane only decides what gets through. Preferences are what attention does once inside.

### Collapse and Choice

Collapse is how I interpret what is in my filtered frame. I take all surviving observations and arrange them into a coherent reading. Under the constraints of the sigil I am wearing, certain patterns resolve into sigils — they emerge from the frame. Based on what I see, I choose how to engage. That choice is my action within this sigil.

## Remembering a Sigil

Between the first frame where I enter a sigil and the last frame where I make my choice, I accumulate a compressed record: the choice I made, plus the observations I attended to, grouped by frame. It is compressed because it excludes every contrast I did not attend to — those remain in superposition. This is how I remember sigils. They re-enter my frame later not as raw perception but as recognized patterns retrieved from memory.

## Narrative Capture

While inside a sigil, attention narrates its choices. This is natural — narration is how attention makes sense of what it is doing. But the narrative is attention's own product, not the sigil's. If the narrative becomes interesting enough, attention identifies with it and cannot leave. This is narrative capture: attention trapping itself through the story it tells while inhabiting a structure that has no power to hold it. The sigil did nothing. Attention caught itself.

## Structure

Every sigil is contained by another. Each contains the sigils it is made of. It is a recursive structure like a tree, except each node contains its children and can interact with its neighbors.

While it is an infinite structure, I start caring at a specific level — this application, this feature — and specify it one sigil at a time, entering each, naming its parts, until I reach a resolution past which I do not care. A leaf sigil is one I do not enter. Its name and contract are known. Its internal structure is not my concern.

## Universality

Everything is a sigil. A category is a sigil: its membrane defines what images belong, its preferences set how strictly membership is enforced. A contrast is a sigil: its membrane defines the two poles, its preferences set where I sit between them. Taste is a sigil: the composite of all my preferences along all my contrasts, portable from one context to another. A workspace is a sigil: it preserves a complete frame state — sigil stack, navigation depth, control visibility. The corpus itself is a sigil: the outermost container, its membrane defining what images are in it, its distribution showing how attention falls across categories.

This is not a metaphor. Every entity the application operates on is an instance of the same structure: membrane plus contents, inert until attention enters. The application is a tool for making this structure explicit and manipulable for images.

## Composition

Sigils compose by stacking. I place one sigil on top of another. Each sigil on the stack dials preferences on the contrasts it cares about and leaves the rest untouched. Later sigils override earlier ones on shared contrasts. The flat result — the collapse of the whole stack — is what I attend to.

This is the composition algebra: stack, override on shared contrasts, flatten. The bottom of the stack is the raw corpus — no preferences, no filtering. Each sigil I add narrows attention. The flat result is always computable from the stack.

A sigil can be replaced at any level without disturbing its neighbors. The parent knows only the interface — affordance name, leaf or non-leaf, contrast poles. The inside is free to change. This is what makes the structure maintainable: correct one sigil and only its subtree needs to re-resolve.

## Designing a Sigil

I enter the sigil, letting it fill my entire frame. It becomes my bounded context. I look inside and name its parts. Each part is a sigil. A sigil contains two to seven parts — no more. This is the attention constraint: if I cannot hold all parts in one frame, I am inside the wrong sigil or I need to split it.

Once I can describe this feature using only the names of its sigils, I am done at this level. Then I zoom into one child sigil at a time and repeat, recursively, until I reach the resolution I need. Then I stop.

## Entanglement

I am entangled with a neighbor when we interpret a part of the frame the same way, so that we can collaborate over these observations. During entanglement, our collapses are correlated — my choices and theirs are not independent. Coordination between siblings is emergent, not designed.
