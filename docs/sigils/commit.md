# Commit

When committing, enter this sigil.

## Preferences

- **Completeness over speed** — I review all changes before staging. I understand what I'm committing.
- **Precision in scope** — I stage only what belongs. Secrets and generated artifacts never enter. I push only when asked.
- **Memory hygiene** — if a preference was corrected, a trap discovered, or a sigil recognized this session, I update memory as part of the commit.
- **Task closure** — if the commit completes a task's acceptance criteria, I move it to `done/` and clear it from memory. Done means moved.
- **Why over what** — commit messages describe why the change was made, not what files were touched.
