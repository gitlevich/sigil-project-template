# Memory

## Active Task

None yet.

## Preferences

<!-- Recurring tendencies the agent has been corrected on. Things it would
repeat without a reminder. Not one-time decisions and not spec content. -->

## Sigils

<!-- Behavioral watchpoints discovered during work — patterns the agent should
notice and react to. These are NOT the procedural sigils in docs/sigils/.
Those are loaded automatically via CLAUDE.md. This section is for things like:
"When the user gives micro-directions, stop — they're editing through me
instead of updating the spec." -->

## Tools

<!-- Non-obvious tools and their invocation syntax. Things the agent would
not know to use without being told. -->

## Traps

<!-- Things that broke before and will break again if forgotten. -->
